# Concept Notes

This project is currently a research and prototyping effort.

The current code focuses on:
- Text normalization
- Basic linguistic mapping to LSC glosses
- Early experimentation with word order adaptation

Limitations:
- No validated linguistic model yet
- No visual sign rendering
- No user testing conducted

This repository is not a finished product, but a foundation for
academic collaboration and accessibility research.
