# LSC-Access
An open-source accessibility project aimed at reducing communication barriers for the deaf community through LSC-oriented text processing.

# Overview
LSC Access is an open accessibility project focused on improving access to digital information for deaf and non-verbal users through the conversion of written Spanish into Colombian Sign Language (LSC).
The project aims to bridge the gap between digital content and sign language users by providing a scalable, language-agnostic infrastructure that can later be adapted to other sign languages and regions.
# The Problem
Most government platforms, institutional websites, and digital services do not provide sign language accessibility.
As a result, deaf users often face barriers when accessing essential information such as public services, education, healthcare, and legal content.
While text-based accessibility exists, it does not fully address the needs of users whose primary language is sign language.
This is not a full LSC translation system.
# Why This Matters
Digital accessibility is not optional — it is a human right.
Providing access to information in sign language:
Promotes social inclusion
Reduces dependency on intermediaries
Respects linguistic and cultural identity
Aligns with international accessibility and inclusion standards
LSC Access seeks to contribute to a more equitable digital environment by making sign language a first-class accessibility feature.
# Project Vision
Although initially focused on Colombian Sign Language (LSC), the project is designed to be adaptable to other sign languages and regions.
The long-term vision is to create an open, extensible framework that allows institutions, NGOs, and researchers to:
Integrate sign language accessibility into digital platforms
Adapt the system to different sign languages
Contribute models, datasets, and improvements collaboratively
Knowledge and accessibility should be free and shared.
# What the Project Does (Conceptually)
Processes written Spanish text
Applies linguistic normalization and reordering suitable for LSC
Converts the content into sign-language-friendly representations
Serves the output through an API
Makes the content accessible via a browser extension or other interfaces
# Current Goal
Develop a functional prototype composed of:
A backend API responsible for text processing and sign language mapping
A browser extension that allows users to activate LSC accessibility on web pages
At this stage, the focus is research, linguistic modeling, and architectural validation, not full production deployment.
# Project Status
🟡 Research and prototyping phase
Core logic under development
Linguistic structure exploration
Early architectural experiments
No production release yet
This project is open to academic guidance, institutional collaboration, and technical mentorship.
# Technologies
Python (text processing, linguistic logic)
Node.js (API layer – planned)
JavaScript (browser extension – planned)
Technology choices may evolve based on research outcomes and institutional collaboration.
# Roadmap
[ ] Research LSC linguistic models and structures
[ ] Formalize text normalization and LSC ordering logic
[ ] Develop a minimal API prototype
[ ] Build a basic browser extension
[ ] Seek feedback from deaf users and accessibility specialists
# Collaboration & Support
LSC Access is seeking:
Academic guidance in linguistics, accessibility, or human-computer interaction
Collaboration with NGOs focused on deaf inclusion or digital accessibility
Feedback from members of the deaf community
Technical mentorship to ensure ethical and inclusive development
This project is driven by learning, social impact, and responsible innovation.
# Ethics & Accessibility Principles
Community-first development
Respect for sign language as a complete linguistic system
Transparency and openness
No replacement of human interpreters — only support and accessibility
